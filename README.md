# Robot-Obstacle-Avoidance-Fuzzy-Logic
This project implements an obstacle avoidance system for a robot using fuzzy logic. LiDAR data is used for distance measurement, and the robot’s speed is adjusted based on proximity to obstacles. The system also integrates YOLOv4-tiny for object detection, enabling real-time decision-making for efficient navigation.
